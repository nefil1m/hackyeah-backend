        The mission of cigbutt movement is to eliminate cigarette butts from the face of the earth and make better use
        of recyclable material like bottle caps by recycling them back into reusability, or handing them to charities
        who recycle the materials and buy wheelchairs for disabled children through the profit. You will be able to turn
        in plastic waste you used into discount coupons, and cash by delivering it to the nearest allocation point while
        saving the environment at the same time! But you may ask why the effort?

        How is plastic so bad you might ask? and why should I put any effort into helping? The world is as of now
        creating about 300 million tons of plastic every year. Unfortunately, although plastic is a valuable item, a
        considerable lot of these items are made for single-use - with an expected 50 percent of plastic utilized once
        and discarded. Not only is this harmful to the environment and the oceans, but it is also harmful to wildlife -
        where it impacts nearly 700 species in the ocean, and humans. As of now, just nine percent of the world's
        plastic is reused - an issue in light of the fact that most plastics are not biodegradable and normally take
        over 400 years to biodegrade. The average time for a plastic bottle to completely degrade is at least 450 years.
